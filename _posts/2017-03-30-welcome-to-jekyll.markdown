If you ever come to Lisbon in the spring, you will find there is no better place in the world.
The sun is shinning and a lot of people already go to the beach, but sometimes, it still rains.
Yes, we have the Tagus river, a big one, but we also have the beach nearby, you just have to cross the bridge.
Let me say it's a big bridge. Actually we have two. The one I was talking about is 25 de Abril. The other one is bigger and it's called Vasco da Gama in reverence to our great navigator who discovered the sea path to India. By the way, 25 de Abril is a holiday in Portugal (25 of April). It's the carnation revolution anniversary. It was the day the Portuguese got rid of dictatorship and we started living under democracy, on 1974.

We have many churches, a castle, and a lot of museums, most notably Gulbenkian, a foundation/museum made from the art collection of Calouste Gulbenkian, an Armenian immigrant. Yes, we like people from other countries. They are all welcome. So, if you are thinking about the best place in the world to live when you are old and rich, you can come to Lisbon. Seriously, you can come now if you want. Everybody is welcome on this beautiful city.

The best place in spring!

Well, I have just installed `Jekyll` and I had to make a first post, and now it's done. See you soon.

You are very welcome here...  
...and here is some python:

{% highlight python %}
def say_hello():
  print("Hello, World!")

say_hello()
{% endhighlight %}

And now, just for future reference I shall not erase the following lines:
