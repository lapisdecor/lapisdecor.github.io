I'm a Portuguese python programmer.

My first contact with a computer was in 1983 while in high school where
I learned BASIC on a terminal connected by modem to a large computer. It was hard
because the modem kept disconnecting and we had to start our programs from the
beginning all the time, but I loved it.

Then I went to university to learn Geography and Regional Planning while working as
a journalist at a radio station. Since then I had many different and interesting jobs,
some tech related, some not, but I've allways missed programming.

So in 2013 I started learning.
I learned Python, R, Java, C and Haskell. I did it mostly online, using old computers and giving them
Linux superpowers.

Today I'm a happy programmer. You can't be too, it's never late to start coding
and you have [open source](https://github.com), [MOOC's](https://www.mooc-list.com/tags/programming), [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

I recommend you start with [Python](https://www.python.org/).
